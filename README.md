# AI-Chatbot

-  A simple rule based AI Chatbot crafted using Python. The bot engages in the conversation analysing the user input. The user interacts by entering text, and the Chatbot processes the input to generate appropriate responses. The system incorporates conditional statements to handle various scenarios and has conversation snippets that add a personalized touch.

- The prompts from the user end added for the conversation snippets:
    - What is your favourite color?
    - What genre is your favourite?
    - It's raining!
 
- Basic features implemented:
    - Basic functionality
    - User Interaction
    - Responses Variety
    - Error Handling

> Note: The code is based on if-else conditional statements and not Machiene learning concepts.

> Challenges faced: Couldn't import the "chatterbot" package in both local and virtual environment, Importing other packages also caused issues which happened to be time consuming. Hence I had stick with conditional statements only to implement the project.
